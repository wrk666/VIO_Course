CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/local/share/sophus/cmake/SophusConfig.cmake

  but it set Sophus_FOUND to FALSE so package "Sophus" is considered to be
  NOT FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Sophus could not be found because dependency Eigen3 could not be found.
